# Note Taker w/ Express.js

![license badge](./public/assets/images/license-badge.svg)

- [live site](https://sheltered-reaches-49948.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

A note taking app combining [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) and [npm UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid). Deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)

Given an existing code base, this project aim was to incorporate a node backend, using GET, POST and DELETE requests to a server.

### My motivations

Experimenting more with node backend development, and learning to use Express, and understanding the basics of CRUD development. First time deploying with Heroku as well.

### What problem does it solve?

Replaces localStorage with something better and more robust.

### What I learned

CRUD development and how routing works, as well as using the [POSTMAN app](https://www.postman.com/) during development for testing all the api endpoints.
